This repository demonstrates using Guzzle for testing REST API's with PHPUnit.

First of all you need to install `composer` for installing dependencies.

If you have already, install dependecies with,

	composer install
	
To running tests,

	vendor/bin/phpunit --testdox

Special thanks to [Norbert C. Maier](https://github.com/normai) for adding tests for Guzzle 4. See pull request #2 for other notes.
